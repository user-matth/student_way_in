## Getting Started

Prior to commencing the development process and working with the codebase on your preferred IDE, certain services need to be established in order to ensure successful project execution.

## Run the project

Not you must have already installed [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/7_0_release_notes.html) and we reccomend to use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) as Rails Version Manager.

```bash
rvm install 7.0.4.2
rvm use ruby-7.0.4.2
```

1. Install project dependencies ```bundle```. If having problems installing try forcing it, ```bundle install --redownload```.

2. Start Developing. Navigate into your new site’s directory and start up the local server ```rails s``` 🎉.

See the [reference guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) to read more on other commands you can use with the ```rails --help```.
